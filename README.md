# AI-Powered-Indoor-Obstacle-Avoidance
This project performs indoor obstacle avoidance using computer vision. The system processes input video from a robot-level camera, detects obstacles like chairs and boxes using image processing, and guides safe navigation by identifying free paths for smooth autonomous movement.
